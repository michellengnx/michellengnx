### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
- :seedling: I'm Michelle. I'm working as a Software Engineer, mostly with back-end services and database.  

- :school: I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, double minor in Math and Statistics at the University of Toronto. 

- :zap: I am doing research on Human Computer Interaction and exploring ways to make CS education better for everyone. I am also on K8s release team starting v1.32. I was previously at Scotiabank and Seneca College ITS. 

- 👾 Outside of school and work, I enjoy weightlifting, boxing, running or anything fitness related; a good iced coffee (send your recs my way) and hanging out with friends.
